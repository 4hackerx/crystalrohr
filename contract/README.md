## TODO

- [ ] Implement a faux vrf service for other chains without vrf using block.timestamp.
- [ ] Write NatSpec format comments for all functions and state variables.
- [ ] Implement proper access control for functions (e.g., onlyOwner, onlyNode).
- [ ] Use OpenZeppelin's contracts for standard implementations (e.g., Ownable, IERC20).
- [ ] Integrate with Chainlink VRF for secure random number generation in node selection.
- [ ] Consider implementing a stake slashing mechanism for misbehaving nodes.
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and input validation for all functions.
- [ ] Implement events for all significant state changes to facilitate frontend updates and off-chain tracking.
